            <strong>EcoGuide</strong>:
            As an environmental activist I launched and implemented an
            "Eco Shopping Guide" for the German City of SaarbrÃ¼cken.
            It was supported by Friends of the Earth
            Germany (BUND) and officially declared part of the local
            <a href="http://www.un.org/esa/sustdev/documents/agenda21/">Agenda 21</a>
            of SaarbrÃ¼cken municipality.

            <a href="http://www.kfw.de">KfW Bankengruppe</a> is the German
            government-owned development bank. Their mainframe based IT systems were migrated to
            a client/server infrastructure in the 1990s. I&nbsp;worked as a software developer
            for the IT department that implemented those structural changes.
