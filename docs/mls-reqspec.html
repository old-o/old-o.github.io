    <h1>Multiple Language Support in International Software</h1>

    <p class="smaller">
        <em>[Published Oct 2000, reflects technology at the time]</em>
    </p>

    <h2>Language Support: Overview</h2>

    <p>
        This document
        describes the requirements for multiple language support in software
        applications and IT services. E-commerce is assumed as the primary
        field for these services and applications.</p>

    <h3>The E-commerce Scenario </h3>

    <p>
        In an e-commerce
        scenario there are companies that run a business and want to use
        information technology (like IT software, IT hardware, data,
        knowledge and so on) to improve their service. For clarity these
        parties are called <em>"e-com providers"</em> and their
        relevant employees are called <em>"e-com operators"</em>. The
        persons or organizations that utilize the e-com services and pay for
        them are simply called <em>"customers"</em>. The software
        company that develops the solutions for the e-com provider is simply
        called <em>"international"</em>.</p>
    <p>
        In the era of
        global communication networks the notion of an "application"
        running as an "installation" on a certain "machine"
        is not fully appropriate. At least in the case of the World Wide Web
        the term "service" seems more applicable. The user
        interface (UI) of such a service is split: a server produces markup
        source code that describes the user interface but the presentation of
        data and user interaction is done by a web browser. The rise of WAP,
        WML and PDAs (Personal Digital Assistants) increases the distribution
        of communication services even more.</p>
    <p>
        In this document
        the term <em>"user agent"</em> is used for the devices and
        software that let (potential) customers "browse the net".
        The term <em>"application"</em> is used for a service that
        provides content to such browsers and also for "installations"
        of an "in house" application used by e-com operators. The
        user agents are external components that can only be controlled
        within the capabilities they offer. The server-side components and
        the "in house" components are subject to the software
        development of international.</p>

    <h3>Internationalization</h3>

    <p>
        <em>Internationalization</em>
        abbreviated as "i18n" is often treated as the
        process that externalizes all components of an (existing) application
        that deal with linguistic and other localized resources and behavior.
        After the step of "i18n" the application&#146;s language
        should be easily replaceable. The process of <em>localization</em>
        ("l10n") then produces translated and re-localized
        resources and results to adapted behavior of the application in
        different languages. Support of these processes is sometimes called
        <em>"National Language Support"</em> (NLS).</p>
    <p>
        NLS often
        assumes the replacement of language in an application-wide sense: One
        language is used for all dialogues and text data within the
        application. In contrast, <em>"Multiple Language Support"</em>
        (MLS) relates to multilingual flexibility at runtime: Several
        languages can be selected - even intermingled in any dialog.</p>
    <p>
        MLS includes or
        builds upon NLS. MLS requires facilities to mix symbols from
        different human writing systems - like the Latin, Cyrillic, Urdu
        (Arabic) or Han (Asian) script. The set of desired languages leads to
        a set of required symbols and thereby to required encoding schemes,
        fonts, input methods, format styles, character and string sizes and
        so on. The main part of this document is concerned with MLS. NLS is
        only described for completeness.</p>

    <h3>National Language Support (NLS) </h3>

    <p>
        NLS comprises
        selection of a default language either by choosing the right binary
        to ship or download or by default settings within a choice of
        supported languages. The first approach is the less flexible and
        limits functionality.</p>

    <dl>
        <dt>Requirement:</dt>
        <dd><em>There is no hard-coded application-wide language in international-applications.</em>
        </dd>
        <dt>Requirement:</dt>
        <dd><em>There is a certain set of supported languages that the application is able to use.</em>
        </dd>
    </dl>

    <p>
        The notion of
        "supported languages" is useful and straightforward here.
        In the next chapter it is refined, though.</p>

    <dl>
        <dt>Requirement:</dt>
        <dd><em>A global setting determines the default language of the application.</em></dd>
    </dl>

    <p>
        These basic
        requirements belong to traditional NLS. They are fundamental but not
        at all sufficient.</p>

    <h3>Multiple Language Support (MLS)</h3>

    <p>
        MLS is necessary
        because often multiple languages have to be used within one
        installation of the application. This applies to countries with more
        than one official language (e.g. in Switzerland) or to communications
        with participants from different countries. In such situations it is
        necessary to support more than one language at runtime. Since the
        e-commerce market is global, especially for telecom products, this
        specifically applies to international applications.</p>

    <dl>
        <dt>Requirement:</dt>
        <dd><em>For international applications National Language Support (NLS) is not
            sufficient. Multiple Language Support (MLS) is required in the sense
            described in this document.</em>
        </dd>
    </dl>

    <p>
        Consequently it
        is not enough to provide only a possibility to extend static
        linguistic resources for texts of the user interface. It has to be
        possible to extend the dynamically retrieved linguistic "content",
        too.</p>

    <h3>General Application Architecture </h3>

    <p>
        The terms "user interface" and "content" touch the area of general
        application architecture. To put up clear and specific requirements
        we need some defined terms for that area.</p>
    <p>
        The application
        is assumed to have several <em>layers of functionality</em>: The
        <em>persistence layer</em> handles the storage of data that persists
        after execution and is kept in a reliable memory like a database or a
        file system on hard disk. The <em>presentation layer</em> is
        responsible for the appearance and behavior of the user interface and
        includes components that control the way data is presented. We use
        the term <em>"data export layer"</em> in this document to
        refer to those components that export structured data for printing,
        email, fax or to communicate with other applications. The <em>business
        layer</em> is the functional core of the application that performs
        calculations and manipulations of temporary data objects (<em>"business
        objects"</em>) and accesses the persistence layer as well as it
        serves content to the presentation layer.</p>
    <p>
        We distinguish
        <em>static persistence components</em> that cannot be changed by the
        business layer and <em>variable persistence components</em> that can be
        changed by the business layer. This distinction is important to
        differentiate <em>content data, </em>i.e. variable persistent data<em>,</em>
        and <em>static persistent data</em>.</p>
    <p>
        External
        components have to communicate with the application via a defined
        interface. The communication of the application&#146;s presentation
        layer with an external user agent is an example for that. The
        application includes a component that we call the <em>"international user
        agent". </em>It provides the "in house<em>"</em> user
        interface to the application that is typically used by e-com
        operators.</p>
    <p>
        All layers of
        functionality must be suited for multiple language support.
        Linguistic settings have implications for user interface, data
        storage, input and output methods and document structure. </p>
    <p>
        MLS imposes some
        requirements that go beyond the NLS necessities. In the following
        paragraph aspects of MLS are discussed. Along with the considerations
        requirements are evolved to define MLS for international-applications.</p>

    <h2>General Implications of Multiple Language Support</h2>

    <h3>Character Representation </h3>

    <p>
        To deal with
        multiple languages we need appropriate means for the representation
        of text data. Languages in the world differ in their visual
        appearance due to different sorts of writing systems and symbolic
        composition. That raises the issue of scripts and characters.
        Moreover, for display and printing specific fonts have to be
        available.</p>

    <h4>Scripts, character sets and encodings</h4>

    <p>
        First we give
        some definitions of terms often mixed and misused.</p>
    <p>
        The term
        <em>"linguistic data"</em> is used in this document -
        instead of "text" - to refer to any data that has different
        representation with respect to the language we use or the region we
        are in. Linguistic data can be text as well as formatted data like
        dates or currencies and it can also be speech samples. </p>
    <p>
        A <em>script</em>
        is a writing system used by certain cultural and linguistic
        societies. A <em>character set</em> is the set of symbols corresponding
        to one or more script(s). A <em>character encoding</em> is a numeric
        representation scheme for a set of symbols, usually specified in an
        encoding table that assigns a unique number to each character. A
        <em>"character encoding standard"</em> is a common definition
        of a character encoding for a certain character set.</p>
    <p>
        Each character
        encoding standard yields a family of languages that can be encoded in
        that standard, e.g. the ISO 8859-1 yields English, Italian, Spanish,
        Danish, German, French, Finnish and some others, but not Greek or
        Turkish.</p>
    <p>
        For the
        representation of character data the use of standards is always a
        good idea. There are established standards for a couple of language
        families. Unfortunately big companies in the IT business have tended
        to use proprietary encodings and some still do. That is one reason
        why conversion between encodings is necessary in many cases.</p>

    <dl>
        <dt>Requirement:</dt>
        <dd><em>
            Character encoding standards are used to achieve compatibility
            between different encoding schemes and languages.
        </em>
        </dd>
        <dt>Requirement:</dt>
        <dd><em>
            For every supported language the main character encoding standards
            are supported.
        </em>
        </dd>
        <dt>Requirement:</dt>
        <dd><em>
            Conversion between character encodings is only limited by the
            range of the character sets that the encodings describe. The codes
            for characters in the intersection of the two character sets are
            always converted correctly
        </em>
        </dd>
        <dt>Requirement:</dt>
        <dd><em>
            The application is capable to convert data between any pair of
            supported character encoding standards.
        </em>
        </dd>
    </dl>

    <p>
        A list of
        relevant character encoding standards is listed in the "character
        encoding" section of the "Reference Resources"
        document.</p>

    <h4>Unicode</h4>

    <p>
        There is a
        character set and a character encoding standard called "Unicode"
        that greatly eases the representation of multilingual data. It is
        intended to include all characters used throughout the world and
        defines a reliable coding scheme for a unification of many scripts.
        The family of languages yielded by the Unicode standard comprises
        almost all languages used in the world.</p>

    <dl>
        <dt>Requirement:</dt>
        <dd><em>Multilingual texts can contain characters from all languages used
            in the world. MLS must not be limited by technical problems of
            character encoding.</em>
        </dd>
        <dt>Requirement:</dt>
        <dd><em>Multilingual data is represented using character encoding
            standards to allow as many languages as possible in one text. The use
            of a recent version of the Unicode standard is
            assured.</em>
        </dd>
        <dt>Requirement:</dt>
        <dd><em>Character conversion to and from Unicode is provided without loss
            of character information.</em>
        </dd>
    </dl>

    <p>
        There is a
        technical format for Unicode text that has many advantages: the UTF8
        Unicode format. It can be used as internal format for text
        representation and processing. Conversion between Unicode UTF-8 and
        many other encoding standards is already supported by a lot of tools
        and software components. See "Unicode-enabled tools" in the
        "Reference Resources" document.</p>

    <dl>
        <dt>Requirement:</dt>
        <dd><em>Import and export of UTF-8 encoded text data
            is supported.</em>
        </dd>
    </dl>

    <h4>Fonts</h4>

    <p>
        To display and
        print text data we need fonts: A font describes how each character
        looks on the screen or in the printout. As long as appropriate fonts
        are available from the operating system all characters of the
        currently used encoding standard have to appear on screen or paper.</p>

    <dl>
        <dt>Requirement:</dt>
        <dd><em>Display and printing of text data makes use of all fonts provided
            by the operating system or runtime environment.</em>
        </dd>
        <dt>Requirement:</dt>
        <dd><em>For all supported languages and character encoding standards fonts
            are provided either to go with the application or as download from
            the website of international.</em>
        </dd>
    </dl>

    <p>
        The availability
        of fonts might depend on the operating system. True Type Fonts (TTFs)
        for example are not yet fully supported by the X window system on
        some Unix OS. The provision of fonts also depends on the type of user
        interface.</p>

    <dl>
        <dt>Requirement:</dt>
        <dd><em>Recommendations of fonts to be used are given in the documentation
            of the application. Customers and their system administrators are
            thereby enabled to install the necessary font
            components.</em>
        </dd>
    </dl>

    <h3>Language definition</h3>

    <p>
        To talk about multi-language
        support for applications we need to define the term &quot;language&quot;
        first.</p>
    <p>
        A <em>language</em>
        is considered as a set of rules for the structure of textual or
        phonetic expressions to use for human interaction. A language is
        usually based on a set of <em>graphemic entities</em> ("characters"),
        a set of <em>lexical items</em> ("words") and a set of rules
        ("grammar"). The grammar defines how lexical items can be
        combined to form valid <em>expressions</em> ("sentences").
        For some languages lexical items and characters are almost the same.</p>
    <p>
        The focus in
        this chapter is on character-based text processing. An estimation and
        distinction of structural complexity determines the set of languages
        for which multiple language support seems possible in that sense.</p>
    <p>
        No estimation of
        "phonetic feasibility" of certain languages or language
        classes can be developed in this document. Some considerations on
        phonetic interaction with the user appear in subsequent sections.</p>
    <p>
        The term
        "supported" in the previous chapters was quite vague. We
        now define more precisely what "language support" means.
        Focussing on character-based text processing we introduce the notion
        of <em>"feasible languages"</em>. The following requirement
        describes the motivation of this concept:</p>

    <dl>
        <dt>Requirement:</dt>
        <dd><em>It is possible to add feasible languages to the application
            without recompilation, i.e. without any coding effort in the source
            code of the "business layer" of the
            application.</em>
        </dd>
    </dl>

    <p>
        After this
        process the language becomes an <em>"available language"</em>
        and is effectively supported then. The set of available languages is
        always a subset of the set of feasible languages.</p>

    <dl>
        <dt>Requirement:</dt>
        <dd><em>After a language has been added to the application it becomes part
            of the "available languages". All options and capabilities
            of MLS described for "available languages" then apply to
            it.</em>
        </dd>
    </dl>

    <p>
        For every
        application a <em>reference language</em> is needed. The reference
        language is available when the application is delivered for the first
        time and cannot be deleted or become unavailable. </p>

    <dl>
        <dt>Requirement:</dt>
        <dd><em>The set of available languages is never empty. A reference
            language that has to be chosen by the e-com provider is always
            available. When the application is initially installed all necessary
            linguistic data is available in the
            reference language.</em>
        </dd>
    </dl>

    <p>
        The English
        language is considered the base language that should be available in
        every application. This is reasonable not only for the use but also
        for the development and maintenance process that can be coordinated
        and evaluated using English as reference language.</p>

    <dl>
        <dt>Requirement:</dt>
        <dd><em>It is highly recommended to choose English as the reference
            language. Software development process, translation process and
            administration are quicker then.</em>
        </dd>
    </dl>

    <p>
        More details on
        "adding a language" and similar tasks are given in the
        "maintenance of MLS" section.</p>
    <p>
        The following
        chapters figure out different levels of feasibility along with
        relevant language classifications.</p>

    <h3>Language classification by character set</h3>

    <p>
        The <em>character set of a language</em> is the character set of the script(s) of that
        language, i.e. the set of all graphemic entities used in the writing
        system of that language. In this chapter the size of this set is
        discussed as a criterion to classify languages.</p>
    <p>
        The notion of "characters" simplifies the structure of language. Printed
        English texts can be considered as a totally ordered sequence of
        tokens each of which designates a unique symbol from a set of around
        100 "characters". But in other languages there are accents,
        diacritics or even "sub-strokes" within "characters",
        e.g. in Japanese or Korean. That is why the term <em>"graphemic entity"</em> is used.</p>
    <p>
        Graphemic entities are "complete characters" that can be put in
        sequential lines, one after the other, like in "E.s.p.a.&ntilde;.a",
        to form valid "character strings". In contrast,
        "E.s.p.a.~.n.a" is not a sequence of graphemic entities.
        The "&ntilde;" is an example for a "compound"
        entity. The "n" is a component of it that also is an entity
        itself, e.g. in the word "nada". But the other component
        "~" is no graphemic entity itself.</p>
    <p>
        The number of
        different graphemic entities is what we usually call the "size
        of the character set" (abbreviated as "nchar"). Having
        said that, it is possible to make some classifications, using rough
        numeric measurement of <em>nchar</em> as "rule of the thumb".</p>
    <p>
        European
        languages usually have a quite close relationship between graphemic
        entities and articulated sounds. Therefore their character sets are
        quite small (with less than 200 symbols in the alphabet). These
        languages are called <em>&quot;alphabetic</em>&quot; languages with
        regards to the {alpha, beta, &#133;} order of many of these character
        sets. By means of the derived lexicographic ordering they also bear
        an inherent facility for sorting algorithms.</p>
    <p>
        Examples of
        alphabetic languages include those based on the Latin script like
        English, German, Spanish, Swedish, modern Turkish, Rumanian and much
        more. Others examples are Cyrillic-based languages like Russian, or
        the Greek language with its script. There are non-European examples,
        too.</p>
    <p>
        The alphabetic
        languages are the easiest to support because the graphemic entities
        fit on a keyboard (with use of SHIFT and ALT) and can be encoded
        using 8 bits even without character overlay for compound entities.
        Fonts are available for all major alphabetic languages on any
        operating system.</p>

    <dl>
        <dt>Requirement:</dt>
        <dd><em>Alphabetic languages (nchar &lt; 200) are feasible
            languages.</em>
        </dd>
    </dl>

    <p>
        If the graphemic
        entities relate to syllables rather than single sounds the term
        "syllabic language" applies. There can be distinct
        characters for different pronunciation variants of syllables. Due to
        the greater number of syllables (and their variants) such languages
        also have much bigger "character sets". An example for a
        mixture of alphabetic and syllabic languages is the Thai language.
        Syllabic languages usually have some hundreds of graphemic entities.
        To simplify the classification we define any language that has a
        character set of that size to be a <em>"syllabic language"</em>.</p>

    <dl>
        <dt>Requirement:</dt>
        <dd><em>Syllabic languages (200 &lt; nchar &lt; 1000) are feasible
            languages if they can be treated as alphabetic languages with big
            character sets.</em>
        </dd>
    </dl>

    <p>
        In many <em>syllabic</em>
        languages the graphemic entities do not only relate to articulation
        but also to meaning. Sometimes the shapes of the symbols depict
        semantic aspects. The "character sets" is even bigger for
        such languages and usually comprises thousands of graphemic entities,
        for example in Japanese, Korean or Mandarin. These languages are
        called <em>"ideographic syllabic languages"</em>. American or
        European keyboards do not suffice to type these languages. Specific
        input methods, character encoding schemes and fonts are necessary for
        these languages.</p>

    <dl>
        <dt>Requirement:</dt>
        <dd><em>Ideographic syllabic languages (nchar &gt; 1000) are feasible

        </dd>
    </dl>

    <p>
        A language <em>"can be treated as an alphabetic language"</em> if there
        is a total
        order for the set of all graphemic entities with each entity
        identified by a unique number. If corresponding standards for
        character encoding and necessary fonts exist then the language can be
        technically treated like an alphabetic language. Lexicographic
        sorting then relies on the provided ordering.</p>
    <p>
        The language
        classes mentioned cover a big part of the known human languages. Due
        to the definition of alphabetic languages the previous requirements
        can be summarized as:</p>

    <dl>
        <dt>Requirement:</dt>
        <dd><em>A languages is feasible if it meets the following conditions
            <ul>
                <li>text of that language can be represented as linear sequence of
                    graphemic entities (characters)
                </li>
                <li>graphemic entities (characters) are taken from a linearly ordered
                    character set for which character encoding standards exist.
                </li>
                <li>fonts are available for the encoding standard and the operating
                    system
                </li>
                <li>the character set is included in the Unicode Standard 3.0</li>
            </ul>
        </em>
        </dd>
    </dl>

    <p>
        The last
        condition is a technical one that presumably does not exclude any
        language that satisfies all other conditions. But it is a good
        condition for feasibility that can be easily evaluated.</p>
    <p>
        These conditions
        imply that compound graphemic entities (like "&ntilde;" in
        Spanish, "&ouml;" in German, complex Thai characters or
        even the compound symbols for Hangul syllables) have to be considered
        as single elements of the character set with unique encoding and
        position in the linearly ordered character set.</p>
    <p>
        This strict
        "alphabetic approach" has the advantage of simplicity but
        also bears some ignorance. For example, there are input methods for
        compound graphemic entities in many languages that use the concept of
        <em>"combining characters"</em> and <em>"character
        over</em>lay" to reduce the number of required keys on the
        keyboard. See the section on input methods in the chapter on user
        interface.</p>

    <h3>Language classification by text flow</h3>

    <p>
        Textual data
        usually consists of lines of text. Lines are linear sequences of
        characters. Words mostly appear in the sequence as blank-separated
        sub-sequences. Some languages, like Thai, do not separate words by
        such delimiters (see "information on special issues" in the
        "Reference Resources" document).</p>

    <dl>
        <dt>Requirement:</dt>
        <dd><em>Correct line breaking is only guaranteed for languages that
            separate words by certain delimiters, e.g. space characters. For
            non-delimiting languages specific methods of text processing have to
            be applied.</em>
        </dd>
    </dl>

    <p>
        The direction of
        text flow depends on the language. In most cases the linear sequences
        extend along the left-right-dimension. Languages that behave this way
        are called &quot;row-based&quot;.</p>
    <p>
        A big part of
        the human languages "flows" from left to right
        (L-R-languages), with the first line on the vertical top of the text
        field. In other languages (R-L-languages) lines flow from right to
        left, while lines are still being added from top to bottom. Examples
        of the latter include Arabic and Hebrew.</p>
    <p>
        These two
        classes cover most of the written human languages. There used to be
        bilinear writing systems with text flow changing direction with every
        new line. That style of writing was applied in certain languages of
        ancient times but is not used anymore. But still direction of text
        flow might be mixed in a given text, since expressions of
        L-R-languages can be mixed with those of R-L-languages, e.g. Hebrew
        with English foreign words. Such change of text flow is called a
        &quot;turn&quot;.</p>
    <p>
        There are also
        languages that organize text in vertical columns rather than
        horizontal lines. We refer to those textual arrangements as
        &quot;column-based&quot;.</p>
    <p>
        The row-based
        languages differ to a great extent from column-based ones with
        respect to page layout, presentation of multimedia documents and
        general text output logic.</p>
    <p>
        For
        international-applications row-based text handling is the default and probably
        column-based text handling will not be supported at all.</p>

    <dl>
        <dt>Requirement:</dt>
        <dd><em>Row-based text handling is the default behavior. Column-based
            arrangement of text is treated as a separate class of presentation
            that is not supported yet.</em>
        </dd>
    </dl>

    <p>
        Having said that, a general requirement can be stated:</p>

    <dl>
        <dt>Requirement:</dt>
        <dd><em>Text flow in both L-R-manner and R-L-manner is
            supported.</em>
        </dd>
    </dl>

    <p>
        That means that direction of text flow does not affect "feasibility"
        of a language. The requirements in the previous section define
        feasibility and the required linear arrangement of text is also met
        by R-L-arrangement.</p>

    <dl>
        <dt>Requirement:</dt>
        <dd><em>Necessary "turns" of text flow are possible in any
            context at any level of input or output. Turns are necessary whenever
            a change of the currently used language implies that text flow
            changes direction.</em>
        </dd>
    </dl>

    <p>
        Refer to the
        section &quot;contexts for linguistic settings&quot; for a definition
        of &quot;currently used language&quot; and to "documents and
        text types" for further implications of bi-directional text.</p>
    <p>
        Column-based
        text flow is one of the "special issues" in the "Reference
        Resources" document.

    <h2>Contexts for linguistic settings</h2>

    <h3>Linguistic Settings</h3>

    <p>
        Without a fixed application-wide language it is necessary
        to establish concepts for
        language selection. At runtime the application always has something
        like a <em>"currently used language"</em>,
        <em>"currently used format methods"</em> and <em>"currently used input
        methods"</em> depending on the current context. The notion of a
        <em>"currently used locale"</em> is convenient to summarize
        these settings. "Locales" are widely used concepts to
        accomplish multiple language support:</p>
    <p>
        A <em>locale</em>
        simply identifies a certain language in a certain region or cultural
        variant, e.g. American English, Canadian French, Swiss Italian and so
        on. A locale can be regarded as a combination of a language code (see
        ISO 639 in the &quot;Reference Resources&quot; document), a region
        code (see ISO 3166) and maybe some additional information. A bundle
        of linguistic settings (e.g. format information) is associated to
        each locale.</p>
    <p>
        At any time of
        execution the application utilizes a "current linguistic
        setting" which can be regarded as a bundle of parameters to
        determine its linguistic behavior. Locale specifications are used
        within these settings.</p>

    <dl>
        <dt>Requirement:</dt>
        <dd><em>Linguistic settings use a standardized system to identify
            languages and (regional) variants of those. The &quot;locale&quot;
            concept based on ISO 639 and ISO 3166 serves as a basic layer for
            that system. </em>
        </dd>
    </dl>

    <p>
        Linguistic
        settings govern the linguistic behavior of the application: the
        language for static text elements taken from translation tables, the
        language for content retrieval from the database, the formats for
        times, dates and numbers, the sorting method, the input methods and
        so on. Usually all these settings are determined by a given locale.
    </p>

    <dl>
        <dt>Requirement:</dt>
        <dd><em>Linguistic settings are used to effectuate appropriate linguistic
            behavior of the application concerning
            <ul>
                <li>choice of text translations and presentation templates</li>
                <li>text layout and text flow</li>
                <li>selection of input methods</li>
                <li>data formats</li>

                <li>character encoding and font selection</li>
            </ul>
        </em>
        </dd>
    </dl>

    <p>
        To keep the
        requirements specification open for design decisions, the "locale"
        concept is not used as a technical term within the requirements. The
        more general term "linguistic settings" is used instead. As
        stated above, locales are kept in mind as useful keys to linguistic
        settings but there might be additional elements that cannot be
        derived from locale values.
    </p>

    <h3>Contexts</h3>

    <p>
        Applications for
        global markets with multiple participants in international networks
        have to be adaptable to different tasks of communication. Their ML
        features must be context-sensitive, must allow for flexible but
        straightforward customization and should hide complexity by using
        reasonable default settings.</p>
    <p>
        To achieve
        context-sensitivity we need to define "context". A context
        is considered as a part of the application&#146;s execution with its
        circumstances described by certain parameters.</p>
    <p>
        To talk
        especially about the contexts where language is concerned, we define
        a <em>"linguistic operation"</em> or <em>"l-operation"</em>
        to be any process within the application that deals with, outputs or
        receives linguistic data. Consequently we distinguish l-operations
        for linguistic output<em> (l-out-operations)</em>, linguistic input
        (<em>l-in-operations</em>) and internal linguistic processing
        (<em>l-processes</em>).</p>
    <p>
        There are two main types of l-out-operations:
    <ul>
        <li>
            A <em>"frame"</em> is generated for the user interface
            (described in the next chapter)
        </li>
        <li>
            An <em>"exported document"</em> is generated (described in
            another following chapter)
        </li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        The main type of l-in-operation occurs when
    <ul>
        <li>
            linguistic data is entered by a user.
        </li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        An important type of l-process is:
    <ul>
        <li>A collection of linguistic data is sorted</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        Using these
        terms, a <em>context</em> is constituted by an<em> l-operation </em>of a
        certain<em> type </em>with some<em> parameters</em>. Those parameters
        include the human <em>participants</em> of the communication process,
        the <em>purpose</em> of the l-operation and possibly the <em>location</em>
        (i.e. the locale-values of the environment that the application runs
        on) and the <em>communication and perception </em>channel of the
        l-operation.</p>
    <p>
        The <em>participants</em>
        of an l-operation can be <em>operators</em>, <em>customers</em>,
        <em>administrators </em>or other users. Their identity and linguistic
        preferences are usually known at runtime. Registered users can
        specify their <em>linguistic preferences</em>. These preferences are
        stored in a persistent component like a user database. For
        non-registered users linguistic preferences can possibly be derived
        from the settings of their user agent. Otherwise language selection
        can be offered at runtime and used throughout a session. A <em>session</em>
        is a subsequent set of l-operations that address to the same user.</p>
    <p>
        The <em>purpose</em>
        of the l-operation can be directed towards the user or towards
        administration support (error messages, log files, administration
        dialogs), correspondence to a third party, official or legal matters
        and so on. The purpose determines a certain <em>linguistic view</em>
        that the l-operation has to anticipate.</p>
    <p>
        The
        <em>communication channel</em> is the technical means of communication
        including the protocol/syntax of the data transmission and the type
        of listener/sender to communicate with. The following descriptions of
        l-operations give an idea of possible communication channels: "send
        an HTML page to text-based user agent", "receive input data
        from a user using encoding X in format Y" or "send sound
        samples to the audio output" and so on.</p>
    <p>
        The <em>perception
        channel</em> is the primary type of human sensory perception that is
        used during the communication. It could be audio, visual or tactile
        if the operation directly addresses the user, otherwise the
        perception channel is void.</p>

    <dl>
        <dt>Requirement:</dt>
        <dd><em>Linguistic behavior of the application is sensitive to the context

        </dd>
    </dl>

    <p>
        Most of these
        parameters have to be modeled as values from finite sets of
        possibilities.</p>
    <p>
        For a specific
        application there has to be a concrete model of contextuality with
        parameter ranges like C-TYPE = {frame-out, print-out, email-out,
        user-in, sort}, C-ROLE = {operator, admin, customer), C-PART = { &lt;set
        of user IDs&gt; }, C-PURP = {operate, browse, customize, help,
        error, log}, C-LOC = {en, de, fr, ar}, C-COMM = {gui-html, text-html,
        wml, swing-ml}and C-PERC = {audio, visual, tactile}. </p>
    <p>
        Additional
        parameters and attributes might be relevant for specific
        applications.</p>

    <h3>Customization</h3>

    <p>
        In the previous
        sections we described what "settings" and "contexts"
        are. Now we define how contexts and settings are associated to
        actually control the linguistic behavior of the application.</p>
    <p>
        There are three
        stages at which linguistic behavior can be controlled: <em>customization</em>,
        <em>negotiation</em> and <em>manual selection</em> at runtime.</p>

    <dl>
        <dt>Requirement:</dt>
        <dd><em>The linguistic behavior of the application can be controlled at
            three stages to allow flexibility as well as robustness:
            <ul>
                <li>Customization of default settings</li>
                <li>Negotiation of practicable settings at runtime</li>
                <li>manual selection by the user to override present settings</li>
            </ul>
        </em>
        </dd>
    </dl>

    <p>
        <em>Customization</em>
        defines the desired default behavior in terms of rules that derive
        linguistic settings from context parameters.</p>

    <dl>
        <dt>Requirement:</dt>
        <dd><em>The customization is used to influence the linguistic behavior of
            l&nbsp;operations. These customization rules specify how linguistic
            default settings are derived from context parameters.</em>
        </dd>
    </dl>

    <p>
        Such rules could
        be simple implications like "PARAM=A then SETTING=X", e.g.
        "PURPOSE=admin then locale=en_US".</p>
    <p>
        In some
        situations it could be necessary to restrict or extend the linguistic
        behavior of an l&nbsp;operation in a general way, e.g. to enable or
        disable manual language selection, to activate or to switch off
        parallel language usage, to disable a perception channel, switch off
        negotiation or similar things.</p>

    <dl>
        <dt>Requirement:</dt>
        <dd><em>Customization can also impose conditional rules to alter
            linguistic runtime flexibility. This includes rules that
            <ul>
                <li>enable or disable manual language selection</li>
                <li>activate or switch off parallel language usage (PML)</li>
                <li>disable a perception channel</li>
                <li>override the negotiation stage</li>
            </ul>
        </em>
        </dd>
    </dl>

    <p>
        Such rules could
        be simple implications like "PART=user then PML=no".</p>
    <p>
        Due to the wide
        range of possible customizations users should not be responsible or
        even permitted to edit all these settings. Therefore a two-layer
        approach seems useful:
    </p>

    <dl>
        <dt>Requirement:</dt>
        <dd><em>The customization consists of a protected system layer that is
            only accessible by authorized administrators and a user layer that is
            accessible for users of the application. For every registered user
            language preferences can be set</em>
        </dd>
    </dl>

    <p>
        Changes to the customization are not required very often. The application is
        installed with a reasonably pre-configured set of rules. Changes to
        the customization are possible at runtime in a customization dialog
        but not during a current l-operation.</p>

    <dl>
        <dt>Requirement:</dt>
        <dd><em>After installation the application executes robustly without any linguistic
            customization by the e-com provider because of reasonably
            pre-configured rules for linguistic behavior.</em>
        </dd>
        <dt>Requirement:</dt>
        <dd><em>The e-com provider or authorized administrators/users are enabled

    </dl>

    <h3>Negotiation</h3>

    <p>
        In a certain
        context the application of rules does not necessarily lead to valid
        and practicable linguistic settings. That is because technical
        limitations or other unpredictable constraints could make the desired
        language setting impossible, e.g. if a user agent does not support
        the character encoding for a certain language or if an un-registered
        user has preferences outside the available range of languages. To
        find reasonable compromises in such situations the negotiation of
        linguistic settings, or l-negotiation, is provided.</p>

    <dl>
        <dt>Requirement:</dt>
        <dd><em>A linguistic
            negotiation facility is available at runtime to find practicable
            linguistic settings that follow the customized rules as far as
            possible but also consider technical restrictions of external
            components and other unpredictable constraints for
            language use.</em>
        </dd>
    </dl>

    <p>
        The worst case
        for ML support is the ASCII-only situation where just the characters
        for the English character set are available. This can only occur if a
        very limited user agent requests linguistic data.</p>

    <dl>
        <dt>Requirement:</dt>
        <dd><em>The worst case of l-negotiation is to fall back to plain text
            (ASCII only) mode to serve very limited user
            agents.</em>
        </dd>
    </dl>

    <p>
        If a language is
        not available "second guessing" of approximate relatives is
        sometimes useful, e.g. if there is no Mandarin available the user
        might be happy with Cantonese.</p>

    <dl>
        <dt>Requirement:</dt>
        <dd><em>The l-negotiation is able to find linguistic settings approximate
            to the desired ones.</em>
        </dd>
    </dl>

    <h3>Manual Selection</h3>

    <p>
        <em>Manual selection</em> is the means to let the user override the negotiated
        linguistic behavior. This option is only available if permitted by
        the customization rules.</p>
    <p>
        Within an
        l-operation the current language setting might change, e.g. in case
        of mixed multilingual text being entered. In those cases the user has
        to be able to choose the "currently used language" manually
        and thereby affect the linguistic settings (e.g. direction of text
        flow).</p>

    <dl>
        <dt>Requirement:</dt>
        <dd><em>Within the limitations defined by the customization the user is
            enabled to change linguistic settings at runtime. Especially for
            multilingual data input this option has to
            be available.</em>
        </dd>
    </dl>

    <h3>Parallelism</h3>

    <p>
        As already
        mentioned in the previous section, sometimes only one language is not
        sufficient to communicate with the user. For example in a call-center
        the sales assistant&#146;s language might differ from the caller&#146;s
        language and representations of both (or more) languages would have
        to be displayed. Data entry can also require parallel multiple
        language support to gain the desired input. Other l-operations might
        impose similar requirements. This feature is called &quot;parallel
        multiple languages&quot; (PML).</p>

    <dl>
        <dt>Requirement:</dt>
        <dd><em>The behavior of l-operations can be customized to handle parallel
            multiple languages. </em>
        </dd>
    </dl>

    <p>
        From a usability
        perspective there has to be a trade-off between synoptic presentation
        and selectable views. Since the number of PMLs should not be
        arbitrarily limited the user interface has to be scalable.</p>

    <dl>
        <dt>Requirement:</dt>
        <dd><em>The number of PMLs is not limited to a hard-coded number. The user
            interface is designed to deal with PMLs using synoptic, selectable or
            temporary views to ensure
            usability. </em>
        </dd>
    </dl>

    <h2>ML Aspects of the User Interface (UI)</h2>

    <p>
        The components
        of the application that the user communicates with are called
        <em>"user interface"</em>. A user interface is a combination of hardware
        and software components.</p>

    <h3>User agents</h3>

    <p>
        The application
        delegates UI tasks to a "user agent". The application
        (server) and the user agent (client) use a defined protocol for data
        exchange. </p>
    <p>
        If we want to
        talk explicitly about the internet-based scenario with an external
        user agent we use the term &quot;<em>external user interface</em>&quot;.
        If only international components including an international user agent are involved and
        the user interface is completely in our hands, we use the term
        &quot;<em>internal user interface</em>&quot;.</p>

    <dl>
        <dt>Requirement:</dt>
        <dd><em>Full control of linguistic behavior, including control of input
            methods, is guaranteed for the internal user interface provided by an
            international user agent.</em>
        </dd>
        <dt>Requirement:</dt>
        <dd><em>An external user interface provided by an external user agent can
            not be fully controlled by the application. The application has to
            rely on the interface and standard
            behavior of the user agent.</em>
        </dd>
        <dt>Requirement:</dt>
        <dd><em>Recommendations are given about explicitly supported user agents
            that are known to provide reliable
            linguistic behavior.</em>
        </dd>
    </dl>

    <h3>Perception channels and UI types</h3>

    <p>
        The <em>perception channel</em> is the primary type of human sensory
        perception that is used during the communication with the user. It could be audio,
        visual or tactile if the operation directly addresses the user,
        otherwise the perception channel is void.</p>
    <p>
        For input and
        output of linguistic data the visual and audio channel can be used.
        Input is traditionally entered via keyboard and selections are made
        with a pointer, typically a mouse or trackball. Another method to set
        the focus to a certain element on screen is an &quot;up-down&quot;
        mechanism like in TAB-key operated input masks in DOS, on mobile
        phones or with remote controls for a TV-set. Output is displayed on
        screen as text or other data usually structured within application
        windows and elements of those.</p>
    <p>
        These visual
        ways of interaction are assumed as the default behavior of the user
        interface.</p>

    <dl>
        <dt>Requirement:</dt>
        <dd><em>The visual perception channel is the primary means of interaction
            with the user. Visual input and output appears on a display using a
            keyboard for data entry and the usual method of pointing or setting
            the focus on screen.</em>
        </dd>
    </dl>

    <p>
        Text can also be
        communicated via the audio channel, e.g. using a headset as a
        combination of microphone and speakers. Speech output might be
        sampled or synthesized. A translation table for linguistic data could
        contain sampled speech to corresponding to the stored strings.
        Alternatively speech generation modules for specific languages could
        be used to &quot;read&quot; the translation.</p>

    <dl>
        <dt>Requirement:</dt>
        <dd><em>The I/O-methods to communicate linguistic data are designed for
            extensibility. It is possible to support the audio channel in the
            future.</em>
        </dd>
    </dl>

    <p>
        The way the
        components of the user interface communicate with the user determines
        the <em>type of user interface</em>. Different types of user interface
        allow different scales of functionality and require different
        linguistic behavior. We distinguish main types of user interfaces by
        their primary perception channel and their communicative
        capabilities: Audio UI, text-based UI and graphical user interface
        (GUI).</p>

    <dl>
        <dt>Requirement:</dt>
        <dd><em>MLS is available for at least three types of user interface:
            audio-based, text-based and graphical user interface.</em>
        </dd>
    </dl>

    <p>
        The main types
        of user interface are discussed in following sections.</p>

    <h3>Organization of the user interface</h3>

    <p>
        A user interface
        is usually organized as collection of pages or dialogs. To be
        general, we introduce the notion of <em>"frames"</em> (not
        HTML frames!) that correspond to units of communication. A frame can
        be a <em>dialog</em> or a <em>screen</em>. A dialog is an interactive
        screen that lets the user make some input. Both screens and dialogs
        have an audible variant: <em>"audible screens"</em> that are
        presented in an audible way and <em>audible dialogs</em> that allow
        spoken or other user input.</p>
    <p>
        The components
        of the application that control the way data is "wrapped"
        and presented are called the <em>presentation layer</em> of the
        application. The presentation layer is responsible for the appearance
        of the user interface. For each frame there is a <em>presentation
        template</em> that describes how the frame is presented to the user.</p>

    <dl>
        <dt>Requirement:</dt>
        <dd><em>The user interface is organized as a collection of frames. The
            presentation of a frame is controlled with presentation
            templates.</em>
        </dd>
    </dl>

    <p>
        Apart from its
        presentation a frame has some content: e.g. a frame could be a page
        with a table and the values in the table cells would be the content
        generated by the business layer. For the different types of user
        interface this content would be presented differently, e.g. as a
        structured set of speech events (that read the table loudly), as a
        simple text-based table or as a table that can be rendered by a
        graphical user agent like a web browser. For each of these variants
        we use different presentation templates.</p>

    <dl>
        <dt>Requirement:</dt>
        <dd><em>For each type of user interface there are separate presentation
            templates to control the presentation of a frame and its
            content.</em>
        </dd>
    </dl>

    <p>
        To exploit the
        table example a little more, consider possible column names: e.g.
        "name", "description" and "price" for a
        table that lists some consumer products. These column titles are
        independent of the content that is filled in at runtime. But they
        must be chosen with respect to the currently used language. This is
        achieved using separate presentation templates for each of the
        available languages.</p>

    <dl>
        <dt>Requirement:</dt>
        <dd><em>For each available language there are separate presentation
            templates to control the presentation of a frame and its
            content.</em>
        </dd>
    </dl>

    <p>
        Usually a frame
        corresponds to an <em>l-out-operation</em> that generates the frame. A
        linguistic setting is derived from the context of the l-operation and
        the appropriate language is negotiated. This language is used at the
        presentation level by choice of the right presentation template.</p>

    <dl>
        <dt>Requirement:</dt>
        <dd><em>The generation of frames for the user interface is a main type of
            l-operation (an l-out-operation). The principles for
            context-sensitive MLS apply.</em>
        </dd>
    </dl>

    <p>
        Maybe we even
        need distinct presentation templates for every sort of user agent
        that we support: different web browsers, different WAP-enabled PDAs
        and so on. We cannot anticipate all distinctions that have to be
        made. But with the use of presentation templates we can generally
        talk about frames as units of communication with associated content
        without fixing the presentation scheme in advance. This is to allow
        extensibility of the presentation layer.</p>

    <dl>
        <dt>Requirement:</dt>
        <dd><em>The use of presentation templates makes the presentation layer extensible to
            provide MLS on additional types or subtypes of user
            interfaces.</em>
        </dd>
    </dl>

    <h3>Audio-based User Interface</h3>

    <p>
        The audio-based
        UI provides interaction with speech and sound. This can be useful for
        disabled users, in situations where telephone is involved or simply
        to utilize an additional perception channel to complement the visual
        channel.</p>
    <p>
        The "voice
        browser" initiative of the W3 Consortium (see
        http://www.w3.org/Voice/) can be regarded as a first reference for
        what we might support in the future.</p>

    <dl>
        <dt>Requirement:</dt>
        <dd><em>The design of the multiple language support allows extension to
            support user agents with audio-based user
            interface.</em>
        </dd>
    </dl>

    <p>
        Apart from those
        external user agents the application has capabilities to offer an
        audio-based user interface via the international user agent.</p>

    <dl>
        <dt>Requirement:</dt>
        <dd><em>The international user agent is capable to offer an audio-based user
            interface.</em>
        </dd>
    </dl>

    <h3>Text-based User Interface</h3>

    <p>
        A visual user
        interface is sometimes restricted to text-based interactions (without
        graphical window gadgets and multiple windows on a desktop) due to
        limitations of the user agent, e.g. a text-based WWW-browser or a
        WAP-enabled mobile phone. These technical limitations affect the
        presentation.</p>

    <dl>
        <dt>Requirement:</dt>
        <dd><em>WML-based user interfaces on mobile phones are primarily
            considered as text-based Uis. MLS for such user agents is lead by
            this assumption.</em>
        </dd>
    </dl>

    <p>
        This can be
        handled with appropriate presentation templates. The multiple
        language support might be technically limited on such user agents.</p>

    <dl>
        <dt>Requirement:</dt>
        <dd><em>MLS is provided for user agents with text-based user interface if
            they support appropriate character encoding standards and are capable
            to display the necessary characters. Full MLS is only guaranteed for
            Unicode-enabled user agents.</em>
        </dd>
    </dl>

    <p>
        The problem of
        input methods for non-Latin character sets is especially virulent for
        limited user agents like mobile phones or PDAs because mobile
        hardware and embedded operating systems offer only limited
        functionality.</p>
    <p>
        Text-based user
        interfaces often use the notion of a focus, e.g. a cursor or
        highlighted region. When the focus changes the currently used
        linguistic setting might change, too.</p>
    <p>
        The problem is
        again that this happens on the user agent.</p>

    <dl>
        <dt>Requirement:</dt>
        <dd><em>An external text-based user agent has to keep track of linguistic
            settings when the focus changes. Correct behavior of such user agents
            cannot be guaranteed the international
            application.</em>
        </dd>
    </dl>

    <h3>Graphical User Interface</h3>

    <p>
        The graphical
        user interface is commonly used in modern applications on personal
        computers or workstations to interact with the user. It consists of
        graphical elements ("widgets") that usually reside in the
        application window(s). Text fields, scrollbars, title bar, message
        boxes, selection lists, labeled input fields are examples of GUI
        elements. Many of these elements display linguistic data and have to
        be aware of language settings. A GUI extends the notion of "focus"
        since there is not just a highlighted region in the screen but also a
        set of frames one of which has the focus, i.e. it is the
        <em>"active window"</em>. Since different l-operations are associated to
        different frames, the right linguistic settings have to be activated
        whenever the focus is set to another frame or another input element
        of the current frame.</p>

    <dl>
        <dt>Requirement:</dt>
        <dd><em>L-operations are associated with GUI frames and the linguistic
            settings of these l-operations are associated with the GUI frames,
            too. As the focus changes during execution the linguistic settings of
            the focussed frame are activated.</em>
        </dd>
    </dl>

    <p>
        There are
        different types of graphical user interfaces: Web-GUI on different
        browsers, different hardware and operating systems as well as the
        specific GUI of the international user agent.</p>
    <p>
        WAP-UI and
        specific GUI types depending on the operating system and widget
        library. The presentation of visual interactions to the user should
        be separated from the content selection or business logic to keep
        presentation method flexible. The user interface should therefore be
        kept in mind as an abstract layer and not too many assumptions about
        appearance should be hard-coded into generic GUI design.</p>

    <dl>
        <dt>Requirement:</dt>
        <dd><em>Graphical user interfaces are supported using HTML or other frame
            descriptions. </em>
        </dd>
        <dt>Requirement:</dt>
        <dd><em>The capabilities of the specific GUI styles are utilized as far as
            standard definitions exist for them. Internet standards for markup
            languages of the W3 Consortium and other agreed standards are used to
            ensure compatibility.</em>
        </dd>
    </dl>

    <h3>Accessibility</h3>

    <p>
        The guidelines
        of the W3C for web accessibility are good starting point to make the
        web-based GUI accessible for user with disabilities. At least one the
        types of user interface that the application supports has to follow
        these guidelines. See "http://www.w3.org/WAI/" for
        references.</p>

    <dl>
        <dt>Requirement:</dt>
        <dd><em>The application supports the accessibility guidelines specified in
            the web accessibility initiative of
            the W3C.</em>
        </dd>
        <dt>Requirement:</dt>
        <dd><em>Multiple language support allows extensions to integrate special
            languages or language representations like braille or other support
            for users with diabilities.</em>
        </dd>
        <dt>Requirement:</dt>
        <dd><em>The audio-based user interface can be a way to provide support for
            disabled users.</em>
        </dd>
    </dl>

    <h3>Input methods for linguistic data</h3>

    <p>
        Interactive frames of the user interface often include data input by the user.
        This is considered another type of l-operation.</p>

    <dl>
        <dt>Requirement:</dt>
        <dd><em>Input of linguistic data by the user is a main type of l-operation
            (an l-in-operation). The
            principles for
            context-sensitive MLS
            apply.</em>
        </dd>
        <dt>Requirement:</dt>
        <dd><em>The context for these l-in-operations is often inherited from the
            precedent generation of the surrounding frame. Such inheritance leads
            to a simplified derivation
            and negotiation of
            linguistic settings.</em>
        </dd>
    </dl>

    <p>
        There might be
        problems with data entry in different languages using the same
        keyboard. Since availability of required input hardware can not be
        granted, software methods to fill this gap have to be available.
        Selection tables for the specific character set could be a first
        approach for such situations. For big character sets an intelligent
        presentation of symbol tables is necessary to reduce the amount of
        searching and selecting.</p>

    <dl>
        <dt>Requirement:</dt>
        <dd><em>Hardware-based input methods are replaceable by software-driven
            methods that only assume the means of some simple selection method as
            described above. Ease of use is preserved by &quot;intelligent&quot;
            methods of presentation
            and choice. </em>
        </dd>
    </dl>

    <p>
        An "intelligent"
        method could be to use probabilistic inferences about the characters
        likely to be chosen next. The presentation of selection tables would

    <h2>Documents and text types</h2>

    <h3>Documents</h3>

    <p>
        The perspective
        of multiple language support can be applied to the general concept of
        a document as a structured collection of visual (linguistic and
        non-linguistic) elements and representations of external objects.
        Examples for the wide range of this concept are HTML-pages, any GUI
        window or documents of any MIME-type in general.</p>
    <p>
        Among document
        types there are bills, contracts, licenses, legal content and other
        sorts of formal documents. Some of those documents should be kept in
        their original language independent of the context. Examples are
        legal documents like contracts or purposes like quotation.</p>
    <p>
        The vast domain
        of documents can be divided into several subclasses. For specific
        subclasses the implications for MLS are considered and requirements
        concerning the treatment of these types of documents are discussed.</p>
    <p>
        If structured
        content is generated by the application it might be represented as
        certain kind of document. There is one sort of l-out-operations that
        is specifically concerned with the generation of documents. We can
        call them the <em>doc-out-operations</em>.</p>

    <dl>
        <dt>Requirement:</dt>
        <dd><em>Documents of any kind are considered as structured collections of
            content data, interactive elements and references. Documents can be
            multi-lingual and multi-medial.</em>
        </dd>
        <dt>Requirement:</dt>
        <dd><em>A document model assigns a certain type and a certain structure to
            each document. Linguistic properties are part of that model.</em>
        </dd>
    </dl>

    <p>
        Documents usually contain linguistic data.</p>

    <dl>
        <dt>Requirement:</dt>
        <dd><em>The generation and processing of documents are main types of
            l-operations since documents are expected to contain linguistic data.
            The principles of MLS apply.</em>
        </dd>
    </dl>

    <p>
        The number of
        languages in the document can be counted. This yields non-lingual,
        monolingual and multilingual documents. An appropriate encoding for
        the document and its inherent languages has to be used.</p>

    <dl>
        <dt>Requirement:</dt>
        <dd><em>The representation of monolingual and especially multi-lingual
            documents uses appropriate character encoding standards. The default
            encoding standard for linguistic data in documents is Unicode.</em>
        </dd>
    </dl>

    <p>
        Documents are
        similar to static representations of UI frames and can be printed and
        exported in several ways. For example, documents can be saved and
        loaded. Documents contain different types of text.</p>
    <p>
        Documents have a
        prevalent direction of text flow. A document contains linguistic data
        with possibly different direction of text flow. A document can be
        mono-directional or bi-directional. A mono-directional document is
        either left-to-right or right-to-left. </p>
    <p>
        A document has a
        format that can depend on the linguistic setting</p>

    <dl>
        <dt>Requirement:</dt>
        <dd><em>The treatment of bi-directional documents follows the
            specifications of the bi-directional algorithm by the Unicode
            Consortium.</em>
        </dd>
        <dt>Requirement:</dt>
        <dd><em>More specific requirements for the representation of documents,
            the layout and encoding of documents have to be stated. Especially

            concretely.</em>
        </dd>
    </dl>

    <h3>Input and Output of documents</h3>

    <p>
        Printing of
        documents, sending faxes and e-mails are common tasks that have to be
        aware of language settings. These procedures are examples for output
        l-operations, which do not communicate primarily via the display or
        audio channel.</p>

    <dl>
        <dt>Requirement:</dt>
        <dd><em>Printing of documents, sending faxes and e-mail and similar output
            procedures are treated as l-operations with full sensitivity for
            linguistic settings and customizations.</em>
        </dd>
    </dl>

    <p>
        An input method
        that builds a bridge to the vast domain of formatted printed
        documents is the scanning of documents combined with optical
        character recognition (OCR). This could be used to convert those
        documents into well-formatted, well-structured text files. Evaluation
        and extraction of such files can be seen as another type of
        l-operation.</p>

    <dl>
        <dt>Requirement:</dt>
        <dd><em>Recognition of documents is an l-operation for data input
            (l-in-operation) for documents with a defined format, document
            structure and known language. The principals of MLS apply.</em>
        </dd>
    </dl>

    <h3>Types of linguistic data</h3>

    <p>
        Documents and
        frames embody linguistic data to a great extent. From an MLS point of
        view linguistic data can have different levels of complexity. The
        easiest case is linguistic data that is precisely and completely
        known at design time: Texts that do not change, are not composed at
        runtime and that do not contain any variable parts. For this sort of
        linguistic data the term &quot;static linguistic data&quot; is used.
        Static linguistic data can be kept in translation tables and
        calculations concerning text size, font sizes and necessary character
        sets can be made for all translations that are already present in the
        tables.</p>

    <dl>
        <dt>Requirement:</dt>
        <dd><em>Static linguistic data is available in translated form for every
            available language. Only the persistent data provided in the
            maintenance process is used. No static linguistic data appears in the
            source code of the application.</em>
        </dd>
    </dl>

    <p>
        Dynamically
        generated linguistic data that contains variable elements or needs to
        be composed at runtime for other reasons poses a higher demand to the
        logic of text processing. Information about the format of such text
        has to be available for generic composition of such texts. These
        formats might differ for different languages, e.g. when word order is
        concerned and sentences or text must be combined with numerical
        values, etc.</p>

    <dl>
        <dt>Requirement:</dt>
        <dd><em>Dynamically formatted linguistic data automatically appears in the
            format that is correct for the current linguistic setting. To make
            this possible format specifications for such data are available in
            persistent components and not in the source code. </em>
        </dd>
    </dl>

    <p>
        If we don&#146;t
        know anything about the content or format of a block of linguistic
        data at design time we call it &quot;<em>freestyle data</em>&quot;.
        This case might appear when linguistic data is entered by a user in a
        free text field or when external sources deliver such data without
        any possible anticipations about the format it has. In the case of
        free text no translation table approach is applicable. Automatic
        translation of free text does not work since the task is too complex
        and rather leads to amusing results.</p>

    <dl>
        <dt>Requirement:</dt>
        <dd><em>Freestyle linguistic data is presented as it was imported or
            entered. That implies that it appears in the language that was used
            when the text was produced.</em>
        </dd>
    </dl>

    <p>
        The maximum size
        is what we know at least for freestyle data. We can enforce format on
        such data by an acceptance logic, e.g. by matching the input against
        certain format patterns and only accept specific formats. But these
        patterns can depend on the language that is used.</p>

    <dl>
        <dt>Requirement:</dt>
        <dd><em>Freestyle data is replaced by dynamically formatted data whenever
            possible to get higher control on such data. The used formats are
            chosen with respect to the linguistic context.</em>
        </dd>
    </dl>

    <p>
        There is another
        case of non-translation: Some texts or documents contain legal
        content or have to keep their &quot;<em>original</em>&quot;
        representation and language for other reasons. For example names of
        global products that persist on the whole planet lead to &quot;original
        text&quot; too.</p>

    <dl>
        <dt>Requirement:</dt>
        <dd><em>Original linguistic data (like in citations or legal documents)
            which has only one inherent language is not translated. It appears in
            the original language independent of the current language settings.</em>
        </dd>
    </dl>

    <h3>Other formatted data</h3>

    <dl>
        <dt>Requirement:</dt>
        <dd><em>Locale-specific formats for the following types of data are used:
            Dates, numbers, currencies, addresses (maybe more).</em>
        </dd>
    </dl>

    <h2>Storage of ML data</h2>

    <h3>General requirements</h3>

    <p>
        To cooperate
        with storage facilities in a straightforward manner they should
        provide some functionality for MLS or at least NLS.</p>

    <dl>
        <dt>Requirement:</dt>
        <dd><em>The database used has to support locale-aware storage of
            linguistic data and provide all necessary character sets for string
            representation, especially Unicode.</em>
        </dd>
    </dl>

    <p>
        Document storage
        should be flexible and allow a distinction between content and
        presentation of the document data. Special features in the document
        storage system for multiple language support would ease document
        handling.</p>

    <dl>
        <dt>Requirement:</dt>
        <dd><em>The method of document storage should be flexible and allow a
            distinction between content and presentation of the document data.
            The representation of multilingual documents should be possible.
            Multiple character sets, especially Unicode should be supported.</em>
        </dd>
    </dl>

    <h3>Storage of Content Data</h3>

    <p>
        Content data is
        maintained by the e-com provider and can be accessed and changed by
        the application. It is primarily stored in the database. Content data
        is often multilingual and the database design has to reflect this:</p>

    <dl>
        <dt>Requirement:</dt>
        <dd><em>The database
            design reflects MLS: the structure of tables and relations is
            designed to support multiple languages and instances of multilingual
            entities contain all available translations.</em>
        </dd>
    </dl>

    <h3>Storage of Static Linguistic Resources</h3>

    <p>
        The storage of
        static linguistic resources is maintained in the design process. To
        allow flexible runtime behavior all linguistic data is kept outside
        the source code in resource files or presentation templates.</p>

    <dl>
        <dt>Requirement:</dt>
        <dd><em>Linguistic
            resources are organized as modules. Each module stores a certain type
            of resource for the available languages.</em>
        </dd>
    </dl>


    <h2>Maintenance of MLS</h2>

    <p>
        An application
        that provides MLS needs principles on how to keep its linguistic
        behavior extensible but consistent.</p>

    <dl>
        <dt>Requirement:</dt>
        <dd><em>Maintenance principles for MLS are applied to keep linguistic
            behavior of the application extensible but consistent and reliable.</em>
        </dd>
    </dl>

    <p>
        There are
        different sorts of changes that can be made to the application. The
        most important and frequent occurs when content data is changed,
        deleted or added by the e-com provider. This happens at runtime via
        certain components of the application that only the e-com provider
        has access to.</p>
    <p>
        Other changes
        like modifications of dialogs in the user interface or even the
        addition of a new language to the application are less frequent and
        require a <em>"design process"</em> that possibly involves
        the software company.</p>
    <p>
        We introduce the
        term <em>"design process"</em> that happens at <em>"design
        time"</em> to distinguish the <em>maintenance of presentation</em>
        <em>templates</em> and other static resources (e.g. static translation
        tables) from the <em>maintenance of content data </em>that can happen
        at runtime. This design process is not supported by the application
        itself. Design and translation tools are used to do this work. The
        design process does not require any access to the source code of the
        application.</p>
    <p>
        The extension of
        the application to support an <em>additional language</em> has effects
        on both presentation and content data. It is performed by a
        maintenance tool that has writing access to all linguistic resources
        of the application that are subject to the necessary translation
        process.</p>
    <p>
        The following
        chapters describe the different processes in more detail.</p>

    <h3>Maintenance of Content data</h3>

    <p>
        If the
        application deals with multilingual content that is maintained,
        updated and extended by the e-com provider then we need an ongoing
        process of MLS maintenance: Whenever content data is added to the
        persistence layer the provision of all necessary translations is
        required for all available languages. The content must not be
        accessible to user before the complete set of translations is added
        to the database. We call this the <em>strict maintenance principle</em>.</p>

    <dl>
        <dt>Requirement:</dt>
        <dd><em>The strict maintenance principle demands that translations of
            content data are present in the persistence layer for all available
            languages to make that content data available.</em>
        </dd>
    </dl>

    <p>
        This principle
        is supported by the components that are used to edit the persistent
        content data. A mechanism to mark incomplete content data must be
        available to prevent this data from usage and to guide the
        translation of content data.
    </p>
    <p>
        It is very
        likely that more than one person is involved in the translation and
        that not all translations are ready at the same time. The
        translations have to be technically produced in a controlled process.</p>

    <dl>
        <dt>Requirement:</dt>
        <dd><em>The translators can either make their translations of content data
            with a translation tool provided by international or they have to deliver the
            translations in a defined format and encoding.</em>
        </dd>
        <dt>Requirement:</dt>
        <dd><em>The text files produced by translators are imported into the
            persistence layer such that a consistent and valid state of content
            data is guaranteed.</em>
        </dd>
    </dl>

    <p>
        To keep data
        accessible while not all translations have been made the relevant
        content data can be marked as <em>"deferred"</em> and the
        data of an existing reference language is used instead of the
        required translation.</p>

    <dl>
        <dt>Requirement:</dt>
        <dd><em>The components that control the maintenance of content data keep
            track of incomplete content data. Missing translations are marked as
            "deferred" and a copy of content data from a reference
            language is used instead.</em>
        </dd>
    </dl>

    <p>
        To point out that these copies are no proper replacement for long
        term the "deferred" state of the translation is indicated after a
        certain period of time.</p>

    <dl>
        <dt>Requirement:</dt>
        <dd><em>A "reminder" mechanism is used to indicate the deferred
            state of translation.</em>
        </dd>
    </dl>

    <p>
        If too many
        elements of content data are deferred for a certain language the
        language cannot be considered "available" anymore. To
        control such situations it is possible to pose a limit on the rate of
        deferred entries. If this limit is reached the language becomes
        unavailable. Then the language is not used by the application unless
        more translations are provided. This has strong implications, so the
        limit is customizable by the e-com provider (by administrators).</p>

    <dl>
        <dt>Requirement:</dt>
        <dd><em>A limit can be set for the maximum rate of deferred elements of
            content data of a language. If this limit is exceeded the language
            becomes unavailable with all consequences. The language stays
            unavailable until the rate of deferred translations is decreased.</em>
        </dd>
        <dt>Requirement:</dt>
        <dd><em>Authorized administrators are allowed to set the limit.</em>
        </dd>
    </dl>

    <p>
        The combination
        of the strict maintenance principle with the possibility to defer
        translations up to a controlled level should suffice to guarantee
        consistency as well as flexibility of multilingual content data</p>


    <h3>Maintenance of Presentation Templates</h3>

    <p>
        The components
        of the application that control the way data is "wrapped"
        and presented are called the <em>presentation layer</em> of the
        application. It uses presentation templates and possibly other static
        linguistic resources to generate the different presentations for
        different languages. These resources are maintained and edited in the
        design process using design tools.</p>

    <dl>
        <dt>Requirement:</dt>
        <dd><em>The maintenance of presentation is done in the design process
            using design tools. Presentation resources are static persistent
            components that can not be changed by the application itself.</em>
        </dd>
    </dl>

    <p>
        Since there are
        different presentation templates for each type of user interface and
        for each language the set of all presentation templates can be
        considered as at least 2-dimensional.</p>
    <p>
        To reduce the
        design effort it would be nice to have something like "generic"
        construction of presentation templates. This means that the
        appearance of a certain frame on the user interface could be designed
        for a set of languages without handcrafted adaptation of the layout
        for single languages of that set. This is actually a hard thing to do
        because the languages have to be very similar in their layout
        properties.</p>

    <dl>
        <dt>Requirement:</dt>
        <dd><em>Generic GUI design and automatic GUI generation is only possible
            for a set of languages with common direction of text flow, common
            range of font size and common maximums for the size of corresponding
            text fields.</em>
        </dd>
        <dt>Requirement:</dt>
        <dd><em>For such languages the presentation templates of one language can
            serve like a fill-in form to produce the presentation templates for
            the other languages of the set.</em>
        </dd>
    </dl>

    <p>
        The presentation
        templates for L-R-languages are especially difficult to design since
        there is bi-directional text involved and user agents tend to assume
        R-L-layout as default. The Unicode Standard defines a Bidirectional
        algorithm that is the guideline to solve that problem.</p>

    <dl>
        <dt>Requirement:</dt>
        <dd><em>Presentation templates for R-L-languages are designed according to
            the Bi-directional Algorithm defined in the Unicode Standard.</em>
        </dd>
    </dl>

    <p>
        The issue of
        generic design of presentation templates has another aspect: the
        consistency of linguistic expression with specified meaning across
        the user interface and across types of user interface or even across
        languages. It is not desirable to have three different expression
        like "Ger&auml;tetyp", "Produktart" and

        if they are supposed to have exactly the same meaning. That could
        easily lead to misunderstanding. Considering legal aspects as well as
        customer care such things should not happen. To provide a consistent

    <h3>Maintenance of Languages</h3>

    <p>
        Language
        management is maintenance of the set of available languages. A
        languages can be added, disabled or deleted. To "add a language
        to the application" means that a language considered "feasible"
        is made available to the application such that all static texts of
        the presentation layer are translated into the additional language
        and all language-specific persistent data structures are extended to
        comprise representations of language.</p>

    <dl>
        <dt>Requirement:</dt>
        <dd><em>It is possible to add a feasible language to the application. That
            requires
            <ul>

                    translatio of all static texts of the presentation layer, e.g. in
                    presentation templates, into the new language

            </ul>
        </em>
        </dd>
    </dl>

    <p>
        It has to be

        without any coding effort in the <em>"business layer"</em> of
        the application.</p>

    </dl>

    <p>
        A language can
        be deleted from the set of available languages. This can occur if the
        corresponding market does not justify the translation and maintenance
        effort anymore. To prevent inconsistencies in the customization or
        the user preferences this data has to be checked and possibly
        adapted.</p>

    <dl>
        <dt>Requirement:</dt>
        <dd><em>An language can be deleted from the set of available languages.

        A language can
